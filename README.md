# ml-censor
This is a machine learning algorithm that takes in an audio feed and censors vulgar words. It is the algorithm I submitted in the Synopsys Science Fair in 9th grade. 

The FINALMAIN.m file is my most updated, recent algorithm and it encorporated all the aspects of the project I was developing. 

The pyuleartest.m file was the file where I tested out my first feature for the Support Vector Machine, the **power spectral density estimate using Yule-Walker's estimate**. This is the ```pyulear()``` function in the Signal Processing Toolbox. I also ended up using the ```pburg()``` and ```pcov()``` functions from the same toolboxl. They both calculate the PSD of the signal using Burg's method and the Covariance method.

The backupMain.m file is the file I used when I needed to make a drastic change to my algorithm but didn't want to mess up the original algorithm.

Have fun browsing!
